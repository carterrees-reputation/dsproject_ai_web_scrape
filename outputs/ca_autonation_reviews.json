            "review_text": "I recently met with Brad, service dept. Director at Chevy AutoNation after a 0 review. He requested I come in and explain which I appreciated. He listened, was kind and took notes so he could improve the situation. He agreed there was a communication failure and was willing to improve the situation in the future. He seemed sincere and expected excellent customer service. More I took my Malibu back 2day to replace a catalytic converter. It arrived at 8:10 a.m. and we were told it would be 2-3 hours but due to some issues it took around 8. We didn\u2019t pick it up because our 2nd car was in use and I had no way to pick it up until morning. I was called and notified which was appreciated and left a message for the Director. I do wish that someone would have let us know that the job was going to take a lot longer than expected. I am giving a 4 because the dealership is trying to improve and resolve issues. I want to wait and see how our future issues are handled before I give a 5. I believe it is a good dealership and Edgar, Jacob, and Taylor were very good during my sale. More",

From our very first interaction, Kathryn was attentive and truly listened to our needs. We needed to sell our 2013 RAM 1500 4X4 to purchase a wheelchair-accessible vehicle, and Kathryn guided us through the entire process with ease. Her knowledge of the market and understanding of our situation allowed her to secure the funds we wanted for our truck, which was a significant relief. More What truly sets Kathryn apart is her exceptional communication skills. She kept us informed at every step, ensuring we felt comfortable and confident in our decisions. Her friendly demeanor made the entire experience enjoyable, and we really appreciated her dedication to helping us find the right solution for our needs. Even after the sale, Kathryn continued to provide support, demonstrating her commitment to her clients. I wholeheartedly recommend Kathryn at AutoNation for anyone looking for a smooth and successful vehicle sale or purchase experience. Thank you, Kathryn, for your remarkable service! More",

I\u2019ve been to other dealerships, and we go through everything, but then at the end, the payments are not nearly what we discuss, so it was a BIG change, and I\u2019m already planning to get my next kid a vehicle from Michael.

            "review_text": "So I went to this place looking at a Honda Odyssey and spoke with Robert T. Mind you I had my own finance company and did not need theirs at all. I had USAA, Navy Federal Apple Credit Union. After sitting down with him I was very clear on what I wanted and the price with everything including I was not going over it. Robert had me fill out the paperwork, and I told him do not run my credit at all. I made it clear before he went over to finance about the price that I was gonna pay. Next a guy from finance approached me talking about Gap insurance that I had a question about gap insurance. I explained to him I never had a question about gap insurance and I know that it\u2019s not what Robert had told him and if it so it was incorrect information. So he explained that he couldn\u2019t go down on the price but $31. I said never mind. I am not taking the vehicle. More He then change the price to go down additional $331 to 15,000. I said 14 five and that is it. He said, 'Well if you cannot do 15 then I guess that would be it,' and I said I guess so. There\u2019s no need for continue with this conversation because neither one of us is budgeted on the price. Robert T then came back to his desk and stated that, 'We doing all of this over $500.00,' and I said, 'Yes we are'. Robert went back over to finance to try to get the $500 taken off. So while sitting there, I received a phone call from Navy Federal that my account has been hacked and money was taken out of my account and they want to confirm it with me. So they stated that they was gonna lock my account to prevent anything else of coming out, I was irritated and I said I\u2019m gonna leave. At this point, someone from finance came over to me and said, 'Because this is happening to you we\u2019re gonna put a hold on everything. We\u2019re not gonna touch anything and move forward any transactions until you cleared up with your bank to make sure everything\u2018s OK'. I said perfect. Once I discussed the fraud with my bank. At this point the next day I receive notification that my credit was ran from their dealership. I reached out to Robert to ask what was going on. Why did they run my credit when they simply said from finance we was not moving forward with anything until I found out what happened with my bank account. He said he don\u2019t know why they did it. I said, 'So you guys must agreed on my 14 five since you just did a hard credit report on me.' Long story short they did not agree on the price. They wanted to apologize and stated that they run credit reports before agreeing on a price and before selling the vehicle. What was the need to run my credit report if I had my own finance company and on top of that if your finance guy named John comes to me and tell me that, 'Because your account got hacked, we\u2019re going to stop everything and not touch your stuff'. So you mean to tell me that anybody feel like any paperwork your credit with get checked. I\u2019m the type of person that looks at my credit report and get notification when it got ran, I realize what you did and called you out on it. At this point I keep calling up there to figure out and ask why did they touch my credit and why did they run my credit for it? They decided to stop answering my phone calls. Say the person wasn\u2019t there that I was looking for and then when my husband call them from his phone, they decided to answer and explained to him that they run everybody credit report before they discussed numbers with them regarding a vehicle. I went to six other car dealerships to see if that would happen and I even asked them and they all told me, 'We don\u2019t run anything without your permission and we don\u2019t we discussed numbers and prices before we run anything,' so no I will never buy from them. I would never refer someone to them and if you do go to them, do not put your social on anything until you have it in writing the price of the vehicle with taxes and registration all included in writing, signed by someone higher like the owner rather then the floor rep or finance person because they will try to change the numbers and change everything. I do not play about my credit score. Oh yeah before my husband went off on John he dropped the price and down to $100.00 more but mind you they kept saying that they couldn\u2019t do that!! More",

            "review_text": "We purchased a truck in July, 2024 with a 90 day/4000 mile warranty. Within the first two weeks, we had an engine lifter issue. We brought it in for repairs.

The people are the same, Coast honors the GM warranty and supposedly fixes the repair Autonation did not.

More Seven months later, all the lifters with a $13500 estimate. Autonation won\u2019t assist at all because Coast did last repair, even though same people and fixing Autonation repair. Corporate office is a joke, taking more than three weeks to get back to me, where someone name Jackson says the \u201chigher ups\u201d denied it for the above reason. Despite my asking over the phone and following up with multiple emails, he will not provide me any information to escalate this to the next level.
